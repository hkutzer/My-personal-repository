Hello, My name is Haley Kutzer. I am a second year Cell and Molecular Biology major at Northeastern University. The most influential courses I have taken so far at Northeastern include General Chemistry, Organic Chemistry I & II, Genetics and Molecular Biology; and, I am currently enrolled in Biostatistic, Biochemistry, and Principles and Methods of Genome Analysis.

I am very interested in learning more about structures of molecules within the body, as well as learning how to analyze genomic data. I think the intersection of Biology and Data Science will lead to very exciting innovation!

My favorite hobbies include running and skiing!
